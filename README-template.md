### What I learned

this was an interesting challenge i learnt a little bit more about box shadows, learnt a little bit about the game logic

### Continued development

This was by far the most difficult challenge i have done so far, the options for the rock, paper and scissors were not well designed and i would really appreciate some pointers on how to improve on this. PLEASEEEEE
